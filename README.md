# OptimizelySDKWrapper-Android

This is a wrapper of the Optimizely Android SDK written entirely in Java. The wrapper makes SDK usage even easier. We also created new functions which some of our previous clients have needed to make the onboarding of the SDK that much easier. 

 


 

<h2><b>Getting Started and FAQ: </b></h2>

 

To use this Wrapper you need to first download the Optimizely Android SDK.

<H2><B>Usage:</B></H2>

After installing SDK add the all files into your app. 

There are a few things you need to change to get started: 

In the “OptimizelyWrapper” file change the ‘jsonDatafile’ variable to point to your datafile. Your link is available in the Optimizely dashboard under Settings. 

Also in the “OptimizelyWrapper” file change the “sdkKey” to your SDK key which is also found in the Optimizely dashboard under the Settings.
